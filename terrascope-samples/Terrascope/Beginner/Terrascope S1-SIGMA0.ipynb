    "Visualization of the three bands (VV, VH polarization, and the ratio of the two) using RGB stacking gives the result below. Cities, villages and forests, with their larger anisotropic nature, appear as yellow-brown areas. Water bodies have a very bright blue color, because both the anisotropic and isotropic scattering is very low. This is because water bodies exhibit specular scattering away from the sensor, so neither VV nor VH polarized waves will reach the sensor. Cultivated land is either blue, grey or red, their variations caused by differences in their scattering and depolarization properties. For example, grey areas depict crops with a more anisotropic nature, while very red areas have a very high VV return depicting e.g. bare soil or very vertical crops."
